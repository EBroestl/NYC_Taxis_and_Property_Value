## Executive Summary

Combine multiple datasets for NYC taxicab data to show emerging trends in the pricing and frequency of trips over an 11-year period. Overlay, and juxtapose with housing prices from Zillow to determine if riders travel within similar wealth districts. Build time filterable dynamic maps and pricing charts. I am interested to see if Taxi prices have risen or fallen in the app era, and if ridership has been affected disproportionately in different wealth areas.

## Motivation

I wanted to find data that can be addressed geospatially, monetarily and has data for at least a decade. I would like to see the way these variables interact, and find good ways to interact with this data visually Data Question Have NYC Taxi-cab prices/pickup frequency increased, or decreased in the past decade? Does the property value of an area influence its ridership, rates and frequency of travel?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A Tableau/Power BI dashboard that displays a map of NYC, with taxi-cab paths, monetary trends, and pick-up trends over the 11 year period.

## Known Issues and Challenges

determining a valuable metric to determine wealth areas in New York -developing a map that can display taxi pathing, and display taxi trips/frequency as a story in a time defined metric.
